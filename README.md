# Code Challenge
This Code Challenge contains solution for the following two problems:

## Problem 1 - Sort the given array as odd numbers first and then the even numbers.
This program get an array input from user and sorts the array in such a way that all the odd numbers are sorted first and then the even numbers are sorted.
Example: If user gives [2, 3, 6, 4, 5], the sorted array would be [3, 5, 2, 4, 6].

Run this program: https://github.com/rajeshpaulrajlister/codechallenge/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hobsons/codechallenge/RunSortOddEven.java

Test cases: https://github.com/rajeshpaulrajlister/codechallenge/blob/master/src/test/java/com/hobsons/codechallenge/TestSortOddEven.java

## Problem 2 - Find all the permutation of the given array.
This program get an array input from user and prints all the permutations of the given array.
Example: If user inputs [2, 2, 3], output will be [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2, 2].
